**Privacy Policy for LaTeX-bot**

This Privacy Policy governs the collection, use, and sharing of personal information by LaTeX-bot, a Discord bot developed by Alve Svarén. By using LaTeX-bot, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

**Information We Collect**

We collect information you provide through your use of LaTeX-bot, such as your Discord user ID, username, the command message content, and the channel ID. We may also collect command data to understand usage patterns and improve LaTeX-bot's functionality.

**How We Use Your Information**

We use your information to operate and improve LaTeX-bot, including providing support and troubleshooting when users report issues. The information helps us improve the bot’s features and understand usage patterns. No third-party services are used beyond our hosting provider, railway.app.

**Sharing Your Information**

We do not sell or share your personal information with third parties. However, LaTeX-bot logs are accessible only to the developer and railway.app for hosting. We may also disclose your information in response to legal processes or requests from law enforcement or regulatory authorities.

**Data Retention**

We retain information for as long as necessary to provide LaTeX-bot’s services or as required by law. If you wish to delete your data, you may send a request with the subject "LaTeX-bot data removal request" to alve@hotmail.se. We will clear logs up to that point.

**Data Security**

We take reasonable measures to protect your information, following recommended Discord safety practices for bot access. Since no persistent data is stored except for logs, these security measures focus on limiting access to bot operations and log data.

**Changes to this Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, and we will post the updated policy on our repository. Your continued use of LaTeX-bot after changes indicates your acceptance of the revised policy.
